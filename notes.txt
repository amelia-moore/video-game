Video Game Notes:

This game is intended to be a old-school Unity story-driven RPG. There are about 6 main characters (as well as their 
later selves or replacement selves, so 12 characters in total), all inspired by real life (their symbolism, not necessarily 
their appearances).
The story is very dialogue-driven. The main characters will likely be characterized by profiles when their dialogue box comes up.
All assets are made by myself, so they may look fine, or they may look not-so-fine. I intend to improve in the future.
