    Scene 1: *****needs major editing*****
    (sitting at your desk, and get up after the doorbell rings)
    You: Looks like she's here
    (go downstairs)
    L: Hey! You free to come and hang out?
    You: Oh, I have some work to get done...
    L: (sad face)
    You: Oh, but a break won't hurt I suppose?
    L: (smiles all around) Great! Come on, let's get the others--
    Old man in distance: oh there you are! I came around earlier but you must've been asleep MC.
    You: Hmm? What's going on?
    Old man in distance: I have to talk to you about something... but not right now. Follow me
    to my shop -- I need to pass on some items from there to you. It's urgent. (leave)
    L: Well, I guess we've found what we're going to do today! But first, let's get the others
    You: Didn't he say to follow him to his shop? He said it was urgent.
    L: Eh, he can wait a bit. Let's just get the others first. They'll be sad if we leave them 
    behind -- I would be if I were them.
    You: .....I suppose so. Alright, but let's make it quick.

    OM: Oh, good! I was afraid you'd gotten lost -- oh, you have friends with you.
    MC: Is this an alone thing?
    OM: Oh, no. It's not an issue. So you got your friends? I mean, that's fine, although this
    is kind of an urgent request... nevermind. Anyways, 
    <explains whole goal, talks about how you gotta sacrifice yourself>
    <maybe ur the chosen one supposedly so says the old man from his research, then later u find
    runes that talk about sacrificing 5 significant items with life inside them works too>
    <samo is distracted and wandering and can't hear>
    L: MC, you have a greater purpose! You're like the main character here, not just the side 
    character anymore! Hey old man, we'll go. You wanted to give us items?
    MC: Wait, this is my life we're talking about--
    <gives magic items>
    L: Thanks so much! Alright crew, roll out!
    MC: I'm gonna die...?

    L: Okay, let's go see the old woods now, like that old man said
