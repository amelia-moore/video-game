Video Game Summary:

Outline of plot:
1. Main town, friends with you
2. Off on a journey to possibly save the town/world (or get a gem for a stone in the town dark/dead woods as the tutorial or 
something, solving puzzles) (Leech comes to your front door first to join you)
-- note that maybe everyone in town is super petty/rude?
3. Friends slowly leave you (walking through the cave to leave the main town)
4. Rago "stays" (he's basically useless, just basically hop from pokemon in that he just goes to your next destination and stands
there and you have to do all the legwork), then betrays you when it hits you that you're completely alone and vulnerable and numb
and you have to give ur life to this stone and you dont want to do that, thus begins boss fight when you realize he's been feeding
off of you and your attention or something
5. Fight in order of Rago, (Reformed or Collateral/Gemini) (or in order of Reformed, Collateral/Gemini but transformed versions
are injured so you have to wait until after Rago to pick them up hey that might work cuz they got separated so their arms have to
split), Leech. Find transformed versions after each fight (either replacing the boss or in a separate room), they join your team.
-- sometime during this journey find that the stone really only needs life or something that would make it so you could just
give them the boss remnants and you'd be totally fine, existential crisis avoided successfully
6. Feed the remnants of the bosses (whether souls or pearls or items or something idk man) to the stone that was said to need to 
take your life, then go back to towns and find those people are actually really nice and you just never realized cuz you were so
numb and accustomed to being emotionally abused

* save points are mirror worlds (have sequence at start of mirror girl slowly numbing, then through save points show her journey to
get up and leave)
