Video Game Log:

August 30:

- Created and uploaded pixel sprites for a couple of main characters
- Fiddled with and got more accustomed to Unity engine
- Made rough sketches in sketchbook for design of the main characters
- Set up pixel perfect camera after lots of scouring the web for the package info and answers to technical issues
- Got graphics for 8bit game style working
- Attempted to upload to Github as a private repo, failed and left for the next day

Left to do:
- Sprites for main characters
- Set up git repo
- Backgrounds + Towns

August 31:

- Successfully set up git repo for the game
- Drew and decided on more designs for the other main characters (2 pre-transformed designs left to do)
- Decided to add a dialogue component to the story, so drew profile shot for one character
- Added documentation (this log, notes/summary for the game, script doc)

Left to do:
- Draw dialogue box: 2
- Decide on definitive story for the game: 1
-- Finish first town: 1a
-- Write up the script: 1b
- Finish sprites: 3
- Decide on font for text scroll for dialogue: 2
(- Do audio, but that should come probably completely last in the project)

Sep 1:

- Decided on story and main points of tutorial town
- Drew Gemini sprites
- Drew Reformed, Gemini houses
- Made movement script for MC (player script) (can I also use that for characters trailing? unsure how i'm going to do that but 
i'll figure something out later)
- Set up dialogue character positioning
- Designed house for Gemini, Rago, and Reformed
- Drew remaining houses + template for a regular house
- Finish assets today, code tomorrow

Left to do:
- Draw surrounding town, house interiors x4 (for now), dialogue box, character dialogue busts, items
-- in order of priority: 2ish
- Write script (at least scene 1): 3
- Come up with name for leech girl, lightning, healer, ice boy, leech transformed, 
reformed pre-change, MC: 1
- need to get camera to follow player and stop at border of map: 1
- Code the players moving etc
- Draw the other sides of sprites (profile l/r, diagonal x4, back x3, frontx2): about 3

Sep 2:

- Made scripts for dialogue characters/box and camera
-- dialogue character icon now follows camera positioning
-- set up camera to follow player
-- set player to be unable to walk out of the camera or off the map
- Debugged those scripts and now they work fine
- Got initial assets in position
- bashed my head in a wall from bugs in my code :D
- Designed and drew outline of shop, coffee shop, mayor/sheriff's house
- Decided on names for the characters
-- Lightning boy: Lexis
-- Leech girl: Komi Domin (after command and dominion but hey look it sounds innocent
shes not that bad right??? right)
-- Ice boy will probably be named Haven (i think ill make him have fire powers tho despite being blue)
-- Leech transformed: Cirra (after cirrus clouds that indicate warmth is coming)
-- Reformed pre-transformation: Luna (but she prefers to be called her middle name Colby lol)
get roasted sis
-- Reformed is gonna be some play on leasaithe (Sheateila? Asheteali) (irish reformed)
-- Healer dude: Aspen (after the super fast growing tree that even grows in winter)
-- MC: Kioku
- Finished small hotspots around the town (bridge, river, etc)

Left to do:
- Edit code scripts to include more abstraction (ex have variables for the offsets of the shifts
so you can include the dialogue box fairly easily)
Note: for other dialogue characters, just have it pick from an array of pngs or just have it switch
skins inside the script itself
- Draw surrounding town, house interiors x4 (for now), dialogue box, character dialogue busts, items
-- in order of priority. overall priority: 1
- Write/edit script (at least scene 1): 2
- Code the players moving and trailing behind MC: 4
- Draw the other sides of sprites (profile l/r, diagonal x4, back x3, frontx2): about 3
